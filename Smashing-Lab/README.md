# Smashing Lab
*24 May 2017*

This lab concerned stack smashing and the various way to protect against it. <br />
From spec.pdf: <br />
"This assignment investigates an old-fashioned way of breaking into systems executing x86 machine code, along with a couple of machine-level defenses against this attack."

This lab demonstrates knowledge of debugging through GDB, machine level operations, and machine language in general. <br />
The actual exploit I wrote to remove target.txt is found in exp.bin.
