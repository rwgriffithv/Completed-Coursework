# Car Project
*17 June 2017*

The objective of this electrical engineering project was to design and code a small car that could follow an unbroken path of black electrical tape and turn an LED on and off when it detects a magnet under the tape.

This was a collaborative project between myself, Taasin Saquib, and Michael Zhou. <br />
We all worked on circuitry and the final report, and I primarily contributed to the introduction, "How we analyzed the test data", "how we interpreted the data", and finally the results and discussion section. <br />
I solely wrote the arduino PD code (PID but we were not required to use integration), and conducted the testing and analysis of our infrared sensors.
