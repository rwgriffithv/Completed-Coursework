# BruinNav Project

This project concerned constructing classes and writing an accurate algorithm in C++ that met a certain order requirement. <br />
The algorithm was required to find the shortest possible route between two "attractions" listed in validlocs.txt. <br />
Microsoft Visual Studio 2015 was used to develop the program.

I wrote the AttractionMapperImpl, MapLoaderImpl, MyMap, NavigatorImpl, and the SegmentMapperImpl classes as well as support.h and support.cpp.

The final product is a text-based navigator that will give a list of directions that include turn-by-turn travel distances and a total distance traveled.
