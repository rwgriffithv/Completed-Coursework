MyMap:
	associate():	If MyMap holds N nodes, associate is O(log(N)).
	find():		If MyMap holds N nodes, find is O(log(N)).

AttractionMapper:
	init():		If the passed MapLoader holds a total of S StreetSegments and A 
			attractions, init is O(S+A*log(A)).
	getGeoCoord():	If the AttractionMapper holds A attractions, getGeoCoord is O(log(A)).

SegmentMapper:
	init():		If the passed MapLoader holds a total of S StreetSegments and a total of A
			attractions, init is O((S+A)*log(S+A)).
	getSegments():	If the SegmentMapper holds V vectors StreetSegments, getSegments is O(log(V)).
Navigator:
	navigate():	If the function assesses (pops from the priority queue and gets segments around it)
			C coordinates, there is an average of S StreetSegments that meet at a
			coordinate, there are V vectors that collectively hold all StreetSegments, and 
			there is a total of A attractions, navigate is O(log(A) + C*log(C) + C*log(V) + C*S).
