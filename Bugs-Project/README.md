# Bugs Project

This project was focused on object oriented programming in C++. <br />
Working in Microsoft Visual Studio 2015, I wrote Actor.h, Actor.cpp, StudentWorld.h, Studentworld.cpp, TestAnt.bug, and report.txt.

The final product is a visual simulation that will run when passed up to four .bug files and a field.txt file. <br />
The details of the project are found in spec.pdf.
