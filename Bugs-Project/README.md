# Bugs Project
*3 March 2017*

This project was focused on object oriented programming in C++. <br />
Microsoft Visual Studio 2015 was used to devlop the program.

I wrote Actor.h, Actor.cpp, StudentWorld.h, Studentworld.cpp, TestAnt.bug, and report.txt. <br />
The rest of the files were provided.

The final product is a visual simulation that will run when passed up to four .bug files and a field.txt file. <br />
The details of the project are found in spec.pdf.
